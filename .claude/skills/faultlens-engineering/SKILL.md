# FaultLens Engineering Router — frontend samples

This is a thin router. Root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` remain the repository-local overlay for sample safety, integration behavior, and validation.

## Operating-role boundary

Canonical role governance comes from `FaultLensHQ/faultlens-engineering/docs/agents/operating-roles.md`, governance **1.2.8**, released source commit `5386de8ea63968424ccc9838c8ba47dc2b78e015`.

- **AI Governor** applies to agent/skill/governance/rule/version/distribution changes.
- **Architecture & Product Governor** independently reviews returned implementation against the actual current PR/head/base/diff/evidence.
- **Execution Agent** may implement, remediate, test and update PR evidence, but does not approve or merge its own implementation.
- Sample work must not redefine SDK public semantics, ingestion contracts, privacy behavior or product truth. Route those decisions to the owning SDK/backend work first.

## Compute and validation economy

Canonical compute/context governance comes from `FaultLensHQ/faultlens-engineering/docs/ai-compute-context-economy.md`, governance **1.2.8**, released source commit `5386de8ea63968424ccc9838c8ba47dc2b78e015`.

- Use strongest reasoning for unresolved product/public-contract/privacy/design questions and strict independent Review.
- Use a medium-cost capable execution model for normal implementation once the contract is settled, and the lowest-cost capable tier for deterministic/repetitive execution.
- Locally run build/compile and focused affected tests or Docker validation sufficient to prove the changed sample behavior.
- Do not routinely duplicate the complete repository regression matrix locally when hosted PR CI runs it on the exact pushed head.
- Hosted PR CI is the authoritative full-regression merge gate where available; broader local suites remain appropriate for uncertain blast radius, CI/build/test infrastructure changes, CI-failure reproduction, unavailable hosted CI, or repository-specific requirements.
- Never weaken, skip, quarantine, baseline or ignore failures to obtain green evidence.

## Pull-request validation and review state

Canonical PR validation/review governance comes from `FaultLensHQ/faultlens-engineering/docs/engineering/pr-validation-and-review-state.md`, governance **1.2.8**, released source commit `5386de8ea63968424ccc9838c8ba47dc2b78e015`.

- Open implementation PRs non-Draft / Ready for review by default; GitHub Ready is not merge approval.
- While incomplete, record `IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS — NOT READY FOR GOVERNOR REVIEW`.
- When the final pushed head and focused proof are ready, record `READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW`.
- Only the independent governor may establish `APPROVED / MERGE-READY`.
- Any commit after governor PASS invalidates approval for the previous head.
- Independent review may proceed while CI runs; merge remains blocked until required exact-head hosted gates are green.

Read root `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, the tracked issue, current package/lock/runtime configuration, and the smallest affected sample path. Do not publish packages or deploy unless explicitly authorized.
